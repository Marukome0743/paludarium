# U10 comparison specification (before guest implementation)

## Inputs and state

Native x86-64 Linux must run in a network namespace with no network access. The guest environment is cases.json, with an empty/nonexistent PATH so node is unavailable. Native HOME/TMPDIR are dedicated scratch directories, mapped to their guest equivalents. Each probe item starts in a separate fresh fixture. All eight items must emit exactly PASS <name> and exit 0. A no-argument standard run must emit all eight in their listed order and exit 0.

Aube receives freshly built identical bytes. Each side starts from fixtures/ and runs --version, install, removes app/node_modules, install --frozen-lockfile, then list. List uses frozen's state. No registry packages or node installation are permitted. The linked package is outside app, but inside the explicitly provided fixture root. Read-only package manifests are data fixtures, independently authored here, not another project's code.

## Comparison rules

Compare exit and complete stdout; never remove FAIL lines, missing checks, unknown lines or mismatched package/version content. Remove ANSI SGR decoration, replace only the exact temporary fixture root with <FIXTURE>, and replace explicitly recognized elapsed-time fields in aube output with <ELAPSED>. Do not erase arbitrary numbers, addresses, versions or entire lines. Preserve original stdout/stderr before normalization. Stderr and filesystem snapshots are retained for diagnosis; any new normalization rule must be documented and cannot silently convert a mismatch into success.

Native frozen and list must each contain 0.0.0, confirming #1645 before emulator differential implementation. If either fails, stop for a human decision. Node absence is observed independently using the probe's environment diagnostic, with ENOENT required. Native network namespace identity and empty routing are recorded; namespace failure is infrastructure failure, not a guest PASS. Every operation has a 30-second outer deadline and child process-group cleanup/reaping, even after nominal success. Expected outputs are generated in each CI run and are never checked in as golden files.
