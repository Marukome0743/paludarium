# @paludarium/wasm

Runs Linux x86-64 guest programs in a shared WebAssembly memory with dedicated
execution Workers. JIT is not available in this package.

```js
import { createPaludarium } from "@paludarium/wasm";

const launcher = await createPaludarium({ wasmUrl: "/paludarium.wasm" });
try {
  const guest = launcher.run({
    program: "/guest",
    files: { "/guest": elfBytes }, // Uint8Array, default mode 0755
    args: ["/guest"],
  });
  const output = new Response(guest.stdout).text();
  const errors = new Response(guest.stderr).text();
  await guest.stdin.getWriter().close();
  console.log(await guest.exited, await output, await errors);
} finally {
  await launcher.dispose();
}
```

Serve the page, Wasm, and ES module Workers from the same origin with
`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and
`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`. SharedArrayBuffer and module Workers
are required. Node.js runs the same execution modules in worker_threads.

`run()` returns Web Streams and an `exited` promise. A guest exit or signal
resolves the promise; an emulator error rejects it with `PaludariumError`.
Errors retain available `rip` (bigint), instruction `bytes`, and `syscall`
(number). Call `kill()` for a cooperative SIGKILL request. Guest execution has
no automatic deadline. Callers may set their own deadline and dispose the
launcher if the guest does not stop. Initialization, diagnostics, and disposal
have bounded host cleanup watchdogs. A Worker trap discards the entire shared
runtime because the abandoned Worker may have held a Rust lock.

Independent `run()` calls create isolated virtual filesystems. To retain state
between stopped guests, explicitly create a filesystem:

```js
const filesystem = await launcher.createFileSystem({
  files: { "/app/program": elfBytes, "/app/input": inputBytes },
  fileModes: { "/app/input": 0o644 },
});
const guest = launcher.run({ program: "/app/program", cwd: "/app", filesystem });
// Drain both output streams and close stdin as above before awaiting exit.
await guest.exited;
const entries = await filesystem.snapshot();
await filesystem.remove("/app/node_modules", { recursive: true });
await filesystem.dispose();
```

Filesystem handles belong to one launcher. A running guest holds an exclusive
lease: snapshot, remove, dispose, and a second run using that filesystem reject
while the lease is active. Disposed handles cannot be reused. Snapshots include
paths, modes, inode/link identity, nanosecond modification times, regular bytes,
and symlink target bytes. They do not follow symlinks. Initial configured files
have epoch modification times; guest-created and modified files use the Host
realtime clock. `cwd` defaults to `/` and must name an existing virtual
directory. `tty` optionally supplies columns and rows in the range 0–65535.
No host filesystem mount or network access is exposed by this API.

Build the one production Wasm module from the repository root with
`bash scripts/build-wasm.sh`. The npm archive includes that module, the launcher
and its required Workers, TypeScript declarations, and Apache-2.0 license.
Publishing is a separate lifecycle step. Verification uses fixed probe/aube
binaries and a fresh Linux oracle for Node, Chromium, Firefox, and real Safari;
results apply to the versions and fixtures recorded in the U11 evidence.
