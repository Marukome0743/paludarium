//! wasm thread spike (U1, BR8.1): wait on an address in shared memory in
//! one Worker and wake it from another.
//!
//! The exported functions only touch the shared flag and never use the
//! shadow stack, so two instances (one per Worker) can share the memory
//! without per-instance stack setup.
#![no_std]
// memory.atomic.wait32 / notify intrinsics are still unstable (nightly only).
